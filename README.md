# Joke App

## üìÑ Description

This project focuses on building a web application that displays jokes to employees before the start of their workday. The app will fetch jokes from a public API and show them in a dynamic interface. It aims to enhance user productivity by incorporating humor into the work environment. The application will also track the user's feedback on each joke to gather insights for the client.

### Objectives

- Learn to consume data from a public REST API using TypeScript.
- Implement asynchronous JavaScript techniques like `async/await` and promises.
- Develop a user-friendly interface to display jokes and allow feedback.
- Track joke engagement and generate reports on user interactions.
